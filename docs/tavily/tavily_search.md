                      When `auto_parameters` is enabled, Tavily automatically
                      configures search parameters based on your query's content
                      and intent. You can still set other parameters manually,
                      and your explicit values will override the automatic ones.
                      The parameters `include_answer`, `include_raw_content`,
                      and `max_results` must always be set manually, as they
                      directly affect response size. Note: `search_depth` may be
                      automatically set to advanced when it's likely to improve
                      results. This uses 2 API credits per request. To avoid the
                      extra cost, you can explicitly set `search_depth` to
                      `basic`. Currently in beta.

                      for your query, while `basic` search provides generic
                      content snippets from each source. A `basic` search costs
                      1 API Credit, while an `advanced` search costs 2 API
                      Credits.

                      `chunks_per_source` to define the maximum number of
                      relevant chunks returned per source and to control the
