Analyze images

Vision is the ability for a model to "see" and understand images. If there is text in an image, the model can also understand the text. It can understand most visual elements, including objects, shapes, colors, and textures, even if there are some limitations.
Giving a model images as input

You can provide images as input to generation requests in multiple ways:

    By providing a fully qualified URL to an image file
    By providing an image as a Base64-encoded data URL
    By providing a file ID (created with the Files API)

You can provide multiple images as input in a single request by including multiple images in the content array, but keep in mind that images count as tokens and will be billed accordingly.
Analyze the content of an image

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "input_text", "text": "what's in this image?"},
            {
                "type": "input_image",
                "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
            },
        ],
    }],
)

print(response.output_text)

Image input requirements

Input images must meet the following requirements to be used in the API.
Supported file types	

    PNG (.png) - JPEG (.jpeg and .jpg) - WEBP (.webp) - Non-animated GIF (.gif)

Size limits	

    Up to 50 MB total payload size per request - Up to 500 individual image inputs per request

Other requirements	

    No watermarks or logos - No NSFW content - Clear enough for a human to understand

Specify image input detail level

The detail parameter tells the model what level of detail to use when processing and understanding the image (low, high, or auto to let the model decide). If you skip the parameter, the model will use auto.

{
    "type": "input_image",
    "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
    "detail": "high"
}

You can save tokens and speed up responses by using "detail": "low". This lets the model process the image with a budget of 85 tokens. The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image. This is fine if your use case doesn't require the model to see with high-resolution detail (for example, if you're asking about the dominant shape or color in the image).

On the other hand, you can use "detail": "high" if you want the model to have a better understanding of the image.

Limitations

While models with vision capabilities are powerful and can be used in many situations, it's important to understand the limitations of these models. Here are some known limitations:

    Medical images: The model is not suitable for interpreting specialized medical images like CT scans and shouldn't be used for medical advice.
    Non-English: The model may not perform optimally when handling images with text of non-Latin alphabets, such as Japanese or Korean.
    Small text: Enlarge text within the image to improve readability, but avoid cropping important details.
    Rotation: The model may misinterpret rotated or upside-down text and images.
    Visual elements: The model may struggle to understand graphs or text where colors or styles—like solid, dashed, or dotted lines—vary.
    Spatial reasoning: The model struggles with tasks requiring precise spatial localization, such as identifying chess positions.
    Accuracy: The model may generate incorrect descriptions or captions in certain scenarios.
    Image shape: The model struggles with panoramic and fisheye images.
    Metadata and resizing: The model doesn't process original file names or metadata, and images are resized before analysis, affecting their original dimensions.
    Counting: The model may give approximate counts for objects in images.
    CAPTCHAS: For safety reasons, our system blocks the submission of CAPTCHAs.

Calculating costs

Image inputs are metered and charged in tokens, just as text inputs are. How images are converted to text token inputs varies based on the model. You can find a vision pricing calculator in the FAQ section of the pricing page.
GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4.1-nano, o4-mini

Image inputs are metered and charged in tokens based on their dimensions. The token cost of an image is determined as follows:

A. Calculate the number of 32px x 32px patches that are needed to fully cover the image (a patch may extend beyond the image boundaries; out-of-bounds pixels are treated as black.)

raw_patches = ceil(width/32)×ceil(height/32)

B. If the number of patches exceeds 1536, we scale down the image so that it can be covered by no more than 1536 patches

r = √(32²×1536/(width×height))
r = r × min( floor(width×r/32) / (width×r/32), floor(height×r/32) / (height×r/32) )

C. The token cost is the number of patches, capped at a maximum of 1536 tokens

image_tokens = ceil(resized_width/32)×ceil(resized_height/32)

D. Apply a multiplier based on the model to get the total tokens.
Model	Multiplier
gpt-5-mini	1.62
gpt-5-nano	2.46
gpt-4.1-mini	1.62
gpt-4.1-nano	2.46
o4-mini	1.72

Cost calculation examples

    A 1024 x 1024 image is 1024 tokens
        Width is 1024, resulting in (1024 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 32 patches
        Height is 1024, resulting in (1024 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 32 patches
        Tokens calculated as 32 * 32 = 1024, below the cap of 1536
    A 1800 x 2400 image is 1452 tokens
        Width is 1800, resulting in (1800 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 57 patches
        Height is 2400, resulting in (2400 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 75 patches
        We need 57 * 75 = 4275 patches to cover the full image. Since that exceeds 1536, we need to scale down the image while preserving the aspect ratio.
        We can calculate the shrink factor as sqrt(token_budget × patch_size^2 / (width * height)). In our example, the shrink factor is sqrt(1536 * 32^2 / (1800 * 2400)) = 0.603.
        Width is now 1086, resulting in 1086 / 32 = 33.94 patches
        Height is now 1448, resulting in 1448 / 32 = 45.25 patches
        We want to make sure the image fits in a whole number of patches. In this case we scale again by 33 / 33.94 = 0.97 to fit the width in 33 patches.
        The final width is then 1086 * (33 / 33.94) = 1056) and the final height is 1448 * (33 / 33.94) = 1408
        The image now requires 1056 / 32 = 33 patches to cover the width and 1408 / 32 = 44 patches to cover the height
        The total number of tokens is the 33 * 44 = 1452, below the cap of 1536

GPT 4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o-mini, CUA, and o-series (except o4-mini)

The token cost of an image is determined by two factors: size and detail.

Any image with "detail": "low" costs a set, base number of tokens. This amount varies by model (see chart below). To calculate the cost of an image with "detail": "high", we do the following:

    Scale to fit in a 2048px x 2048px square, maintaining original aspect ratio
    Scale so that the image's shortest side is 768px long
    Count the number of 512px squares in the image—each square costs a set amount of tokens (see chart below)
    Add the base tokens to the total

Model	Base tokens	Tile tokens
gpt-5, gpt-5-chat-latest	70	140
4o, 4.1, 4.5	85	170
4o-mini	2833	5667
o1, o1-pro, o3	75	150
computer-use-preview	65	129

Cost calculation examples (for gpt-4o)

    A 1024 x 1024 square image in "detail": "high" mode costs 765 tokens
        1024 is less than 2048, so there is no initial resize.
        The shortest side is 1024, so we scale the image down to 768 x 768.
        4 512px square tiles are needed to represent the image, so the final token cost is 170 * 4 + 85 = 765.
    A 2048 x 4096 image in "detail": "high" mode costs 1105 tokens
        We scale down the image to 1024 x 2048 to fit within the 2048 square.
        The shortest side is 1024, so we further scale down to 768 x 1536.
        6 512px tiles are needed, so the final token cost is 170 * 6 + 85 = 1105.
    A 4096 x 8192 image in "detail": "low" most costs 85 tokens
        Regardless of input size, low detail images are a fixed cost.

GPT Image 1

For GPT Image 1, we calculate the cost of an image input the same way as described above, except that we scale down the image so that the shortest side is 512px instead of 768px. The price depends on the dimensions of the image and the input fidelity.

When input fidelity is set to low, the base cost is 65 image tokens, and each tile costs 129 image tokens. When using high input fidelity, we add a set number of tokens based on the image's aspect ratio in addition to the image tokens described above.

    If your image is square, we add 4096 extra input image tokens.
    If it is closer to portrait or landscape, we add 6144 extra tokens.

We process images at the token level, so each image we process counts towards your tokens per minute (TPM) limit.
